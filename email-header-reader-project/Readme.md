# Email Header Reader Project

*** Under Construction ðŸš§ ***

## Introduction

Because of the steep rise in cybercrime and the amount of ridiculous and dangerous phishing attempt emails I've received
in 2022, I've learned how to find out where the emails possibly come from, who possibly wrote them and how to report
them efficiently.
Based on the email headers, and if you don't know, you can find out a lot about these dangerous actors. However, going
through a header file can be quite a tedious task. This program will try to make it easy for you to know things like
which email should you block, from which country the email you received possibly came from and information about the
payload of the email without having to open it.

A few advices here beforehand:

1.  NEVER react to any of phishing attempts. NEVER reply to this email. NEVER engage with the people that have sent you
   such email.
2.  Make a copy of the headers and report them to a trusted provider like GMAIL, if reporting is available
3.  All email providers have at least one report phishing option, and sometimes they have more. Use it at your criteria
   and don't hesitate to do so.
4.  When this program is complete, use it to find out information about who sent you that email on the basis of the
   headers.
